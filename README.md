# node_interview_test
I was given a test at an interview which I completely blew based on working with CSV data. This is practice to ensure that I can actually do something like this. 

Instructions

1. import Tallest Buildings.csv into index.js into array
2. extract building, country, and height (m) data 
3. export this extract into a new csv file to be saved
4. get mean height building
5. get country with most tallest buildings 

run {node index.js} from terminal
